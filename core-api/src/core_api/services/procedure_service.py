"""Procedure ranking + reliability math (Procedural Memory PM-02).

The runtime half of the procedural-memory loop. Ports Brain's
``ProcedureRanker`` (procedural_memory_mcp/src/retrieval/ranker.py) onto
MemClaw infrastructure: candidates and reliability come from
core-storage via :func:`core_api.clients.storage_client.get_storage_client`,
and the semantic component reuses MemClaw's embedding provider via
:func:`common.embedding.get_query_embedding` — Brain's own DB / embedder
are NOT imported.

A procedure's rank is a transparent blend of three signals:

    score = W_SEMANTIC   * cosine(query_embedding, procedure_embedding)
          + W_CONTEXT    * jaccard(query_context, procedure_context)
          + W_RELIABILITY * reliability_score

Quarantined procedures never reach the ranker — core-storage filters them
out of the candidate list. ``record`` (PM-03) is the write side that moves
``reliability_score`` and flips quarantine; this module is read/rank only.
