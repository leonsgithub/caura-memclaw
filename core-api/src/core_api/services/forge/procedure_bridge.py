"""Forge → procedures bridge (Procedural Memory PM-04).

When Forge mints a skill candidate from a session-trace cluster, this
module derives a *structured procedure* from the same cluster so the
mined knowledge is runtime-**suggestable** (via ``memclaw_procedure_suggest``),
not only installable as a SKILL.md. The procedure links back to the skill
document via ``skill_doc_id``.

The emission is additive and failure-isolated: ``run_forge_distill`` calls
the emitter only after ``candidate_writer`` has already persisted the skill,
inside its own try/except, so a procedure-emission failure can never block
or roll back skill minting.

``tools_sequence`` v1 note: session traces do not yet carry an explicit
ordered tool-call list — the harness records *memories*, not tool calls,
into a trace. So v1 uses the representative trace's ordered ``memory_ids``
as the action-sequence proxy. When the harness begins emitting real
tool-call ids into ``signals_summary`` (a future signal extractor), swap
:func:`_extract_tools_sequence` to read them; nothing else changes.
