"""Detect and resolve contradictions between memories on write.

P1 fixes:
- Post-commit async detection (sees all committed data, no concurrency blind spot)
- Correct supersession semantics (new_memory.supersedes_id -> old memory)
- Broader candidate search (threshold 0.70, limit 8)

Multi-provider support:
- Vertex AI, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter via provider layer
- Automatic fallback chain: configured provider -> fallback -> heuristic

You are a contradiction detector for a business memory system.

Two statements contradict ONLY IF they make incompatible claims about the
SAME real-world subject. Different subjects -> NOT a contradiction, even if
the predicates look opposite or the statements look semantically similar.

Statement A (NEW): {new_content}

Statement B (EXISTING): {old_content}

Follow these steps in order:

1. Extract subject_a: the entity Statement A is primarily about
   (person, company, project, product, etc.). Use a short noun phrase.
2. Extract subject_b: the entity Statement B is primarily about.
3. Decide same_subject. Set true ONLY when subject_a and subject_b refer
   to the SAME real-world entity. Treat these as same_subject=true:
     - exact name match
     - known alias / nickname / abbreviation of the same entity
     - role description and proper name referring to the same individual
       in context (e.g., "the CEO" and "Sarah Johnson" when context makes
       it unambiguous)
     - pronoun resolved unambiguously to the other statement's subject
   Treat these as same_subject=false:
     - two different people who share a first name or last name
     - two different companies, products, projects, or teams
     - any case where you are not confident the subjects are the same entity
4. Decide contradicts:
   - If same_subject is false, contradicts MUST be false.
   - If same_subject is true, contradicts is true ONLY when the two
     statements assert mutually exclusive states about that subject
     referring to the same time frame.
   - Updates / corrections about the same subject ARE contradictions
     (e.g., "X lives in Tel Aviv" vs "X lives in Haifa").
   - More specific versions of the same fact are NOT contradictions.
   - Complementary information is NOT a contradiction.
   - Two state claims about the same subject are NOT a contradiction ONLY
     when BOTH statements explicitly reference non-overlapping past time
     periods (e.g., "X lived in Tel Aviv from 2010 to 2014" vs "X lived in
     Haifa from 2015 to 2018" — both can be historically true). In every
     other case, including when only one statement carries a date stamp,
     conflicting same-subject state claims ARE contradictions; do not
     speculate that one might describe a future state that resolves the
     conflict.
