    1. **Strong write_mode** (P1.3). Each ``MemoryCreate`` carries
       ``write_mode="strong"``, forcing the inline enrichment path so
       title/tags/weight are populated synchronously. Previously these
       went out via the fast path's deferred-enrichment queue, which
       isn't consumed in some deployments — leaving memories with
       ``title=null`` indefinitely.

    2. **Pre-loop content-hash dedup** (P1.4). Before any enrichment
       LLM call, batch-query existing content hashes for this tenant.

       heavy batches (the common re-ingest case).
