"""Add verified outcome counters to ``procedure_stats`` (Loop Engineering LE-01).

The Loop Engineering working note's central failure mode is the *Nodding
Loop* (§VI.A): an agent that grades its own homework. Today
``memclaw_procedure_record`` moves ``success_count`` / ``failure_count``
purely from the agent's self-reported ``outcome_type`` — and the
``validation_passed`` field the tool already accepts is silently dropped.

This migration adds a parallel counter pair that only moves when an
outcome was *independently verified* (``validation_passed=True`` — set by
the harness's separate evaluator agent, not the generator). The existing
counters are unchanged; these are additive telemetry so a caller can tell
a VERIFIED-reliable procedure from a merely SELF-REPORTED one
(``verified_reliability`` in the record response is computed from these).

Purely additive + reversible: two integer columns, default 0. No backfill
(pre-existing rows correctly start with zero verified outcomes).
