"""A4 #11 — ``find_entity_overlap_candidates`` optionally returns
``conflicted`` memories whose ``supersedes_id`` points at the query
target.

Context
───────
Path C (entity-overlap contradiction) calls
``find_entity_overlap_candidates(memory_id=A, ...)`` to look up
memories that share entities with the new memory A and may conflict.
Today the SQL filters
``status IN ('active','confirmed','pending')`` — so any memory B
that Path A already marked ``conflicted`` (with ``supersedes_id=A``)
is invisible. That makes retraction structurally impossible:
Path C can't retract a verdict it can't see.

A4 #11 adds an opt-in parameter ``include_supersedes: bool`` that
relaxes the status filter to ALSO return ``conflicted`` rows when
their ``supersedes_id`` equals the query target. All other filtering
(tenant, fleet, visibility, deleted_at, id) is unchanged. The
default behaviour (``include_supersedes=False``) is identical to
pre-PR.

Tests pinned BEFORE the implementation. They FAIL against current
main — the SQL has no awareness of ``supersedes_id`` in the status
filter — and PASS after the patch lands.
